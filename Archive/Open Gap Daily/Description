The idea of this trade is to chase the momentum in a financial market where information dissipates not all at once. 
For example, after a strong earnings report, a single stock can open at a very high level on the next trading day compared to the closing price on the previous trading day.
We observe that this uptick continues throughout the next trading day. Therefore, there are opportunities for traders to take advantage of.

Formally, this strategy generates a buy(sell) signal for a singlge stock when the gap between opening price at trading day t and close price at trading day t-1 is considered significant over a fixed period of look back window.

The holding period ranges from a few hours to an entire trading day. 

We choose 50 stocks (listed in Tickers.csv) from S&P500 as our trading universe. The backtesting period is from 2010-01-01 to 2023-01-01.

Further research can be done on optimal lookback window, optimal holding period, optimal portfolio construction, max profit/loss threshold, etc.
