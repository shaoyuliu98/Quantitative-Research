# Systematic Trading Strategies
This repository is designated to quantitative trading strategies in various asset classes, including U.S. Equities (In progress), Rates, FX, Commodity, and Crypto (In pipeline). 

## Current Project
1. Intraday Return Analysis - Is there a general pattern in intraday price movement? When does the highest intraday return occur on average during a typical trading session? How does the profitability relate to trading volume and realized volatility?
2. Gap Trading Strategy - The core logic is to chase the momentum in a financial market where information dissipates not all at once. Let it be positive/negative news related to a publicly traded company, which results in a significant price difference between open price at trading day t and close price at trading day t-1. Therefore, profits can be found before the price climbs up or falls back to the new "fair" equilibrium level.

My name is Isaac Liu. I am a quantitative researcher at a regional bank in the Asset-Backed Securities and consumer lending space. I have practical and hands-on experience in building, developing, and implementing quantitative models in both equities and credit markets. Some of the research topics that I'm interested in are statistical arbitrage, algo trading, and machine learning for systematic trading strategies.
