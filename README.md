# Systematic Trading Strategies
This repository is designated to quantitative trading strategies in various asset classes, including U.S. Equities (In progress), Rates, FX, Commodity, and Crypto (In pipeline). 

## Current Project
1. Intraday Return Analysis - Is there a general pattern in intraday price movement? When does the highest intraday return occur on average during a typical trading session? How does the profitability relate to trading volume and realized volatility?
2. Gap Trading Strategy - The core logic is to chase the momentum in a financial market where information dissipates not all at once. Let it be positive/negative news related to a publicly traded company, which results in a significant price difference between open price at trading day t and close price at trading day t-1. Therefore, profits can be found before the price climbs up or falls back to the new "fair" equilibrium level.   
3. Eigen Portfolio Replication - This is an exercise that explains how to construct an optimal portfolio using the principal components of a basket of securities. The appeal of this approach is the orthogonality of returns among those principal factors.
4. Barchart "Chart of the Day" True Out of Sample Testing - Do free Stock Screening tools really work in practice? In this project, we look at Barchart's free newsletter service that provides daily stock picks and examine how the "alpha" decays over time after the stock selection is made public.
