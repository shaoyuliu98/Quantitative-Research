# Systematic Trading Strategies
This repository is designated to quantitative trading strategies in various asset classes, including U.S. Equities (In progress), Rates, FX, Commodity, and Crypto (In pipeline). 

## Current Project
1. Intraday Return Analysis - When does the highest intraday return occur on average during a typical trading session? How does the profitability relate to trading volume and realized volatility?
2. Gap Trading Strategy - The core logic is that new information dissipates at a slower market overreacts to certain positive/negative news related to the stock, which results in a significant price difference between open price at trading day t and close price at trading day t-1. Therefore, profits can be found before the price falls back to the new "fair" equilibrium level.
